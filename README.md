# AutoTonno
The AUTOTONNO tool - a Matlab implementation for pitch detection and correction.
Based on the AutoTune Toy (version 0.1) by Carl Arft.
Final Project of Digital Audio Processing course, University of Brescia, 2018.

AutoTonno is a simple tool to experiment and implement pitch analysis on a (short) audio signal in Matlab. The name is a mock of the AutoTune tool ("Tonno" means "Tuna" in italian). Its main functions are pitch detection, pitch correction and vibrato. Takes as an input a recorded or imported wave. Outputs graphically instantaneous modifications, and allows to export the corrected wave file.

See the attached presentation for info about the used algorithm.
